# Uni-Q-v1
Description:
***
This is a Drone Store project that uses the DJI and Yuneec store pages as a template that serves as practice tool in building components with Bootstrap 4. The future functionality will be added through Node, as currently DOM markup is employed in rendering different page components. It will draw from a database, posibility built with SQL or NoSQL db such as MongoDB.
